        <hr/>
            <p>
                I'm a Bachelor of Science in Physics Graduand of the Copperbelt University, a Graphic Designer and a Web Developer.
                I gained my interest in physics in the year 2015, upon starting my first year of senior secondary [Grade 10]. Which was fanned to flame by my watching of the 
                <strong>Warner Bros'</strong> sitcom <emphasis>The Big Bang Theory</emphasis>, especially by the person of Sheldon Lee Cooper played by Jim Parsons.
                It also conjured the interest in Web Development, when the physicists and engineer help their friend and neighbour of Sheldon and Leonard, Penny, 
                to build her business website in season 2 episode 18. 
                And i got into graphic design in 2022 december, to satisfy my curiosity of how posters and flyers are made. To which i enrolled in an online graphic design course under Laton Impressions Training Institute, in which i earn a certificate of participation.
